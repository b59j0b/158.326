Create a class diagram   based on the following case   scenario.   Next,   implement the   class   diagram   by creating C#   project of Windows Forms App using   Microsoft Visual Studio   2022.
Alternately, you can also choose to create an ASP.NET Core Empty project and   apply   MVC   architectural   pattern   to   your   implementation   - this   is   optional
CASE 
There are many different types of testing stations   nationwide for conducting   vehicle   inspections.
Each testing station has a   registered name, an   address   and   a   contact   telephone   number.   Some   of   the testing stations which conduct car and truck inspections   are   VTNZ,   DriveSafe,   NZ- WoF,   and AA.
You have to design an application for car inspections done by VTNZ testing station. 
VTNZ offers many services   for inspections.   Different service types   and   prices   apply for   car   and   truck   inspections.   For car inspections, the service type and service   price are   given   in   Table   1.
Table   1
Service Type 
Service Price 
WoF inspection 
$ 50.00 
Modified vehicle check-up 
$ 200.00 
Pre-purchase inspection 
$ 150.00 
Certificate of Fitness 
$ 210.00

Draw the class diagram, showing the   relationship between them.
Hint:    The class diagram   is similar to the example done   in   class. You   should   use   all   OO   concepts   covered   in class (i.e.,   inheritance, wrapper/ interface and association) for   a flexible   design which      can   be extended.
NOTE:    Use proper naming conventions   e.g.   use   camelCase,   prefix   private fields with _ and   prefix   protected fields with z.
Part B: 
Create a new project   in Visual Studio and   implement   the   design   using   the   class   diagram   identified   in   Part A.
Further,   note that VTNZ wants to   keep track of the total number of inspections   carried   out   and   the   total price for them.
To illustrate this screen shots on the following   pages   show you
(1) the basic form   design,
(2) what will be displayed after the   FormLoad event,
(3) what will be displayed after one   inspection   is   requested   and
(4) what will be displayed after two   inspections are   requested.
Hints:    The implementation will be similar to the   example   demonstrated   in   class.
You will have to use shared/static fields/properties/methods to show   summary   information   - ‘Total   Number of Inspections   Requested’ and ‘Total   Price for all   Inspections   Requested’   .
